<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>The Internet is developing and popularizing in China in the 21st century.
  While it is constantly changing the living habits of people, it is also shaking
  different industries, especially the retail department store industry.
  The development of e-commerce has enabled the online retail industry to develop and grow,
  but the survival of offline stores is facing challenges. In 2010, even if rents of shops
  were dropping, it is still difficult to protect the department stores closing under the
  rapid attack of Taobao and Jingdong which both are the e-commerce giants. The offline retail service
  industry was facing a cold winter. At the beginning of 2016, with the development of technology
  and the improvement of productivity, the consumption pattern began to change, further more,
  the period when online e-commerce relies on the rapid development of traffic was gone, more over,
  the profit of e-commerce began to disappear gradually, at last,
  the demand for consumers has changed and the market demand for new retail has begun to manifest.
  Under this circumstance, the offline department store retail industry needs to use marketing strategies
  and enhance the core competitiveness of enterprises to occupy a more favorable position in the market
  when facing siege of the online e-commerce and the capital which is from online to offline. As
  a successful representative of the breakout of physical retail enterprises in the Internet environment,
  In this article we take Miniso as an example and use 4P theory and SWOT to point out its brand position,
  channel construction, and problems in product optimization. Then we propose targeted improvement strategy
  to useful explorations and references for the revival of physical retail
  enterprises under the impact of e-commerce.
